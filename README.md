<b>DungeonRealms Official Source Code (Era #2)</b>
</p>


## Era #2:
Versions: 1.8 -> 1.9

Notable Developers: CherryIO, iFamasssxD, Kneesnap

This repository was the official DungeonRealms code repository from 2015 to the end of 2017.  
This legacy code is no longer maintained. Use at your own risk.

### Phase #1 (CherryIO):  
When Atlas__ purchased DungeonRealms from Minecade, his development team, CherryIO recoded Minecade's code. Unfortunately, it was still highly unstable and poorly built. It took a full year after release to make normal operations stable. However, a new development team replaced the existing one at this point, who decided the only way forward was to recode the game. (Phase 2) 

### Phase #2 (Failed Recode):
NOTE: Not to be confused with the current code. DungeonRealms was recoded once again after this phase, for the final time. This was a failed recode attempt, for the reasons explained below.

In Spring 2017, much of this code was simplified. However, this recode quickly fell apart because the database code was poorly implemented, and the focus shifted from making the best version of DungeonRealms to releasing the new code as fast as possible. Unsurprisingly, the code quality progressively got worse from there, ultimately ending not much better than it began.

While this code was still an improvement, it was still far from being usable over the long-term.
Because of this, the game was completely recoded from scratch in early 2018. 

Unfortunately, we will not be providing build instructions to go along with this version.  
Just compiling it alone was an incredibly messy setup that broke very often.  
We don't want to have to support such a messy code-base.  
On top of that, you have to setup a MySQL server, configure it, setup a FTP server, a lobby server is required to properly handle certain tasks, meaning you need a BungeeCord server too. It would be easier to setup the original code.

## This is an official DungeonRealms code release, released for these reasons:
 - We want the players to have an accurate history of DungeonRealms, and how the game used to work.
 - Minecraft is a platform for tinkering. We want to let players tinker with DungeonRealms, make their own ideas, learn to code, and potentially even become future DungeonRealms developers.

## Licensing
However, we are releasing this under the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license.
This means you may use this code for anything except commercial purposes, such as <b>for-profit</b> practice servers.
